# The-Galactic-Coliseum
A 3D, Sci-Fi, Turn-Based Strategy Game that has been programmed in C# utilizing the Unity Engine.


Players are able to choose from a roster of fighters, each with their own unique attacks, skills,
and traits, making for flavourful gameplay. An affliction system involving statuses such as Poison,
Empowerment, Paralysis is included in these mechanics, adding complexity to the combat. One is also
able to choose from numerous items and arenas, with the former potentially helping change the tides
of a battle.

Code employs animation triggers to execute functions and is extremely efficient. For instance,
it scarcely makes use of the 'Update' function. Functions are executed only when necessary instead
of running each frame, which massively improves performance on mobile and tablet devices. ScriptableObjects and modular code is utilized, which ensures non-programmers can create their own 
characters, abilities, skills and afflictions based on existing code.
